    "monthly_debt_obligations_detail": "₹29,350 (from CIBIL report). Detailed breakdown of recurring monthly payments includes: Home Loan EMI (₹15,000), Car Loan EMI (₹13,000), Life Insurance, Health Insurance, ELSS SIP, and PPF Contribution.",
    "tax_recommendation_reasoning": "The New Tax Regime is recommended because it saves ₹27,529 (38.1%) compared to the Old Regime. This saving is due to the lower tax slab rates, which outweigh the value of the traditional deductions (80C, 80D, etc.) currently being claimed.",
    "dti_note": "Monthly EMI (₹29,350) represents 45.15% of the steady monthly income (₹65,000). The CIBIL DTI is 48% (likely calculated against gross income), which is high but acceptable given the score of 813."
